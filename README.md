# Lab 8 -AI Services + PLaywright E2E Testing 

## Project Overview 
This lab builds directly on Lab 7 (MVC Chat App with CRUD + Persistence) and introduces an AI Service Layer to integrate real large language models
(LLMs) like OpenAI, Groq, and OpenRouter while keeping the core app modular, testable, and secure.
The project adds a configurable AI provider system and end-to-end testing using Playwright, reflecting real-world software engineering practices.
